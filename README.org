* 1. What's this?

The main use of this .emacs.d configuration is to give users of the HackSpace community a quick intro to the emacs editor, and also to provide a flexible but solid foundation on how to customize what will be their own .emacs.d

** Main features:
- EVIL mode by default in many modes
- Clojure development support
- Org Export to Reveal.js for Awesome Presentations
- =Org2blog= for exporting directly to your wordpress site
- =Magit= for using git inside emacs
- (what we think of) Better defaults
- Latex support with latex-pane-editor for quick editing
- =Python= IDE implementation with Elpy and Jedi as backend
- HTML/CSS/JS Support with =web-mode= and =js2=
- Basic Haskell support (you guys can improve on this)
- MongoDB Inferior Mode for MongoDB interactions
- RCIRC for IRC chat with .authinfo.gpg backend
- Smart Mode Line as the Modeline Frontend (customizable too)
- TRAMP support out of the box
- AutoComplete for Ispell and some major languages (pytho,haskell,C, etc)
